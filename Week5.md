## LED Display of Minutes Remaining Until Train Arrival Using a Raspberry Pi

I'm a software gal, never worked with any hardware. And now seemed like a good time as any to change that.

I live about a minute walk from my local subway station. Which is really convenient most of the time, except when you get to the station 12 minutes before the next train arrives and you irrationally contemplate heading back to the apartment to wait there.

It's been a recurring joke amongst me and my housemates, so I decided to built an LED display of minutes remaining until the next train arrival time for our entryway.

I posted extensive and detailed documentation in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/sshovkov/raspberry-train).
