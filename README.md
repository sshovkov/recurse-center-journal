# recurse-center-journal

A journal of my time at [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com), a 12-week programming retreat for developers.

The retreat provides a collaborative space for programmers to challenge themselves and “work at the edge of their abilities.” It operates on an entirely self-directed basis, no classes or curriculums to follow.

Individuals are responsible for creating their own schedules, brainstorming projects, and learning generously.
